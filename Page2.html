                <p class="text">
                    China first opened its market to international investment in 1978, but it remained difficult to get foreign goods for the next few decades. Although consoles were available in China in the 1990s, most gamers preferred to visit arcades since consoles were a luxury and expensive investment. However, as the Chinese market grew more internationalized, foreign items became more affordable, and by the end of the decade, console sales had increased dramatically. Unfortunately, due to a lack of industry control, software piracy has also increased. As a result, players were used to pay full price for games.

                <p class="text">
                    As the industry grew, China's Ministry of Culture determined that playing video games was damaging to young people, harmed national security, and disrupted social order. Foreign consoles were explicitly banned in China in 2000, preventing millions of consoles from industry titans such as Sega, Sony, and Nintendo from reaching the eager market of China's younger generation. This sounds worse than it was, because it did nothing to discourage people from playing games. Due to the annihilation of console competition, the computer gaming sector - which the Ministry of Culture permitted to continue despite the ban - boomed, and Chinese businesses began mass-producing games for the domestic market. The luxury of having a computer with hardware strong enough to play the latest games, on the other hand, was out of reach for many. This resulted in an increase in the popularity of internet cafés, which are less expensive than investing in gaming software and gear and really provide a social network for gamers throughout China. Young Chinese began frequenting gaming cafés, paying by the hour and socializing with other young people who shared a passion for gaming culture.

                    Rumors of a regulation change on consoles began to circulate in China in 2012, and the ban was ultimately lifted entirely in 2015. The major console production businesses didn't have to wait long for a $22.2 billion gaming industry to start lining up. Microsoft's Xbox One was the first to be officially released in China.

                <p class="text">
                    While many expected the recent inflow of foreign consoles to help China's gaming culture blossom even more, the release had a bumpy start. With a list of titles constrained by government content rules, the ban-lift has failed to pique the curiosity of Chinese gamers. The consoles in China actually cost more when they are released than in other countries, which is difficult to justify to a populace that has become accustomed to low-priced goods as a result of piracy. According to a research published last year, 70% of Chinese gamers earn less than $645 per month, while the Xbox and PlayStation were initially priced at $480 and $460, respewctively. Furthermore, due to severe censorship restrictions, many major video game titles will never get an official release in mainland China, driving customers to piracy.

                    Nonetheless, the lifting of the ban on foreign consoles is a momentous event that has opened the door for new chances for this hitherto hidden culture to thrive. Local game creators have been able to partner with global corporations, such as King of Wushu, a Playstation 4 game made by a Suzhou-based company.

                <p class="text">
                    It's easy to see why Western businesses are hurrying to have their goods approved in China, given that the sector is expected to be worth more than $100 billion by 2017 with the Chinese market accounting for around a quarter of it. Outsiders find China's gaming culture difficult and unpredictable, yet it has thrived against all difficulties to become a distinct element of the young culture.
